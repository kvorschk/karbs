KARBS is a fork of LARBS, Luke's Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Scripts. From the LARBS github page, "LARBS is a script that autoinstalls and autoconfigures a fully-functioning and minimal terminal-and-vim-based Arch Linuxenvironment. LARBS can be on a fresh install of Arch Linux or Artix Linux, and provides you with a fully configured diving-board for work or more customization." 

KARBS does the same, only not as minimal and based on the i3 Window manager. LARBS is based on DWM from suckless, and is amazing. I suggest checking it out, as well as Luke's other endeavors. I love DWM and can say nothing bad about it. I just use i3. 

I am doing this for two reasons. First is I am lazy and do not want to configure every machine I use. I like to tinker and that can be a lot on some days. Second is to learn. I have learned much from Luke Smith and thought that he could teach me more if I learned to make the modifications myself. I hope to continue to make KARBS more arch and soystemd centric, and to add a few things along the way.
